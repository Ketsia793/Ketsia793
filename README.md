# Hi there 👋

After a period of exploration in the Artistic world, the need for change led me on a introspection's trip.
I traveled across the vast landscapes of America and lived a long chapter in Canada, this experience deeply transformed me.
Upon returning to France, I chose to reconnect with my roots, reigniting my lifelong passion : Computer Science.
Now, since May 2024, I have been engaged in a Full Stack Developer training program at Ada Tech School, and I am eager to dive into the world Tech !
